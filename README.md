# C-Projects

C projects that I have done. Should be run in an IDE with gcc or clang++.

1. graffit.c and brands.txt:
// Basic use of graphs in adjacency lists and matrices.
// Tests bfs, recursion, dfs on graphs with User nodes, and Friend and Brand edges.

2. Quad.c, q_imageUtils.c, and driver.c
// Use of BSTs and recursion.
// Splits an image into different quads based on the colour of the images [0-255]

3. Turtle.c, t_imageUtils.c, and t_driver.c
// Use of linked lists
// Basic turtle drawing application
